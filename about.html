      <p class="conference-text">
        Founded in 2008, the conference has long provided a time and place for the community of technologists to converge, converse and connect. As the technology footprint in Central PA continues to grow, so too grows the need for information and experiences to be shared and discussed among developers and users alike.
      </p>
      <p class="conference-text">
        This dialogue serves as an integral component in cementing Central PA as a recognized hub of technological innovation. At CPOSC, speakers, attendees and sponsors are all equally relied upon to fuel the fire of that innovation, whether presenting on a topic, asking a question or representing a useful product or service.
      </p>
      <p class="conference-text">
        CPOSC is held in historic Downtown Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
